# Washing_Machine_Controller

This project aims to design a control system using Verilog HDL and DE10 Lite Board.
<br>
The logical problems on which this project was focused included:- <br>
1. Power switch is ON ( Logic 1: ON , Logic 0: OFF).<br>
2. Door is locked (Logic 1: Locked, Logic 0: Unlocked). <br>
3. Water level is high enough (Logic 1: High, Logic 0: Low).<br>
4. Water over flow limit ( Logic 1: Above Overflow limit, Logic 0: Below Overflow limit).<br>
<br>
The motor is turned on only if all the above conditions are met. Build a logic circuit for this washing
machine control circuit.
<br>
There is also a push button
